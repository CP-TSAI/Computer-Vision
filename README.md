## Computer-Vision-NTUST
- Programming project for the course "Computer Vision and Application" at NTUST, 2017

- Implemented by C++/OpenCV/Eigen on Visual Studio 2015

- In [Shape from Silhouette](https://github.com/CP-TSAI/NTUST-Computer-Vision/blob/master/01-Shape-from-Silhouette/README.md), we use the **Silhouette Method** to reconstruct the objects by 8 images from different angles.

- In [Homography Translation between Images](https://github.com/CP-TSAI/NTUST-Computer-Vision/blob/master/02-Homography-Translation-between-Images/README.md), we use the **Homography Matrix Method** to remove the obstacles to get a front view. 

- In [Camera Position Relative to World Coordination](https://github.com/CP-TSAI/NTUST-Computer-Vision/blob/master/03-Camera-Position-Relative-to-World-Coordination/README.md), we use the concept of **Camera Calibration** to calculate the relative position and orientation between camera and world coordination.

- In [3D Reconstruction from Stereoscopic Images](https://github.com/CP-TSAI/NTUST-Computer-Vision/blob/master/05-3D-Reconstruction-from-Stereoscopic-Images/README.md), we use the concept of **Fundamental Matrix** and the properties of images (ex: transformation from color to binary image) to calculate the cooresponding feature points, then reconstruct the 3D object.
