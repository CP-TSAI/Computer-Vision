## Using homography mapping to inpaint an image, and convert it into front view 
- Writing a program for reading JPG/BMP images, calculating homography mapping matrixes 
between them, and inpainting the obstacle region of the image, then convert it into a front-view 
image.

- There are two images given in this assignment, says “1.JPG” and “2.JPG”. Please manually 
pickup at least 4 corresponding coordinates on both images by using any Image Viewer Tool, 
such as Photoshop. Store these correspondences, then, compute their homography matrix. Hint: 
all points on this projection-screen are co-planar. 

- Please manually define the pixel-region of the obstacle, as a mask. Then draw the regions by the 
pixels from other view according to homography transformation. Finally convert it into front 
view image.
