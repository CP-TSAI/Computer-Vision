## Reconstruct 3D from Stereoscopic Images 


#### ABSTRACT

- In this project, we want to reconstruct 3D points from images.

- The Intrinsic and Extrinsic Matrix of the camera are given.

- The Fundamental Matrix of the 

- There are series of images, scanning the statue of a person.

- Built a program for importing both image sequences, and analyzing the synchronized images.

- A fundamental matrix is calculated to assist finding the corresponding features in left and right images.

- Once corresponding features are determined, calculate their 3D, then store them as a .xyz file.
